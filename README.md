## Summary
Simple app to produce stop-motion animations

## Background
My son's grade 3 class is doing a stop-motion animation project and it got me looking for software to use in producing stop-motion videos. I found some interesting examples, like [qStopMotion](http://www.qstopmotion.org/), which I'm using for inspiration.

There isn't really a good reason for me to be building this app, I'm mostly doing it to amuse myself and learn about some areas of software I don't normally get to play with.

The license is currently GPL, simply because that's been inherited from the FFMPEG components. I'm not a fan of that license, so I might replace the AForge.Video.FFMPEG dependency at some point later. If you wish to make use of my own code but remove the GPL dependency, you're pretty safe in assuming an Apache-style license. I'll get around to sorting that out at some point if it actually matters to anyone.
